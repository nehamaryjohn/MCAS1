<h2><center><u>To Kill a Mockingbird</u></center></h2>
<p><font face="times new roman">Description:-<b><i>Harper Lee</i></b>, believed to be one of the most <b><i>influential authors</i></b> to have ever existed, famously published only a single novel (up until its controversial sequel was published in 2015 just before her death).<b><i>Lee’s To Kill a Mockingbird</i></b> was published in 1960 and became an immediate classic of literature. The novel examines racism in the American South through the innocent wide eyes of a clever young girl named Jean Louise (“Scout”) Finch. Its iconic characters, most notably the sympathetic and just lawyer and father Atticus Finch, served as role models and changed perspectives in the United States at a time when tensions regarding race were high. To Kill a Mockingbird earned the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1961 and was made into an Academy Award-winning film in 1962, giving the story and its characters further life and influence over the American social sphere.</p>
